### Hi there! üëãüèª

I am Jacob from the Philippines! I recently graduated as an Information Technology specializing in Web and Mobile Development student from University of Santo Tomas. My passion lies in development, right now I am focusing on developing my skills in front-end and back-end technologies. I also started as a Junior Full Stack Developer just recently after I graduated. Outside of work I love to do physical activies such as going to gym and playing basketball.
